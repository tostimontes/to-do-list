# to-do-list

This is the To-Do List project as part of The Odin Project's Javascript curriculum.

The test item generator populates the list so that all features can be tested.

I used webpack to create the main bundle.

Known issues:

To improve:
- Add agenda, important and completed filter views
- Add edition features for categories and projects' names
- Add animations
- Separate functions in more modules
